## More on CSS

CSS has already been covered in this set of reading notes, but some things can be iterated over again. As we have covered things like dynamic pages and the different kinds of elements that can change like tables and lists, it is important to be aware of all the in-page contigencies that need to be put in place. For example, there can be many different id, classes, and selectors that can be preset or added by the javascript. To cover all of those possible tags with the correct style requires being diligent to systematically cover all bases.
