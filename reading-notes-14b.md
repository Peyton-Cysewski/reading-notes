## What Google Learned About Teams

Google embarked in an internal study in 2012 that was meant to track teams of their employees and try to determine what factors could predict a successful team. After failing to gather any trendy information for a while, it became clear that two main factors were common in groups that were successful. Even if nothing else has a pattern, what did was the fact that everyone in succesful groups had the ability to speak with equal oppportunity and gauge the feelings of other team members. This may look slightly different from group to group but at the end of each day, it looked the same on average. Having team members who were accutely aware of each other's daily mental state allowed people to be open share those feelings with the group. It worked the same with solutions to problems: no one would be afraid to share their idea. This allowed for more creative ideas to reach the table even if they may have seemed too edgy for a different group that woudn't even have been open to the idea in the first place. This study only reinforces to me what only feels natural: no matter the circumstance, in work or play, treat others as you would have them treat you.
