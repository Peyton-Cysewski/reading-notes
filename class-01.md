# Purpose and Structure of Websites

## Who, What and Why

When a website is created, the who what and why need to be kept in mind. First of all, who is this website made for? It may be a person, a company, a group of people, or someting else entirely. This is the driving motivation behind its existence.

Next, what does the website need to do? If this website is for the use of retail copany, then its job should be to get information about specific products to the consumer. If this website is for a cause, then information critical to that cause needs to be displayed up front and in an easy-to-read format.

Lastly, why does this website need to exist? This question can ultimately determine the level of effort put into a website's design. If the website is the primary connection between a company and it's consumers, then it would make sense for them to try to pay as much attention to every detail of hwo information is layed out on their website. Simply put, the relevance a website has to its purpose determines how much time and effort should be put into its creation.

## Structure Information

There are a lot of html tags, but I wanted to highlight some of the ones that aren't commonly used. They are in the *next* tier of frequency.

- <hgroup> It takes any heading (h1 through h6) and merges them together to be treated as on.

- <figure> and <figcaption> These are used when you want to represent an image with a caption. 'Figure' creates a "box" in which 'figcaption' can be placed.

- <div> This is what used to be used for every subdivison of a website from the main section to the smaller articles. HTML5 added specific words, but the 'div' method still functions.
