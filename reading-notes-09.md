# Reading Notes 09

## Forms

Forms are easily recognizeable online (or in real life) as places where information can be typed in and sent off to somewhere. This is commonly seen online as places for info regarding the sales of a product i.e. name, address, and credit card number or bank account number. In HTML there are semanitc tags that specifiy the places for these types of inputs. In fact, the specific places where info is supposed to be typed are input tags. Once the desired information has been typed into the input, it can be sent, saved, or altered with the event of a button, often a 'submit' button.

## Events

Events are the actions that the user can take that that the computer is listening for to iniate an action or execute a line of code. These are referred to as 'event listeners.' Events can range from moving the mouse to a specific location, hovering over an element, or clicking a link. If an event listener detects one of these events, then it goes into a specified code block and executes it. This makes pages dynamic and iteractive to the user.
