# Reading Notes 11

## Images in CSS
Images have predetermined sizes, but they can manually be forced into a new width and height. This will of course distort the image if it is not scaled properly. Images can then be aligned to float left or right in each side of the screen. They are inline elements by default, but they can be changed to type block and then centered. Images an be used as backgoruds as well. If small enough, they can be repeated indfinitely or just once and aligned specifically. Sometimes when text is on an image, it can be hard to read. Background gradients can help the readability.

## Practical Information

### SEO
To optimize search engine search-ability, you need to pay close attention to the keywords in your page title, URL, headings, text content, text links, alternate imag etext, and page descriptions, which live in the head. To figure out what best words to use, a developer should brainstorm what it might look like to Google search for your website or your websites purpose. Once there is traffic to your site, you should use analytic software like Google Analytics to start optimizing that traffic to ultimately get more visitors. Pay attention to where they are coming from and what things on your website they are looking at. To host your site the most reasonable approach for smaller companies is to have a web server company host, as it is cheaper and more reliable. Make sure you choose a domain name that is unique but also works for the brand of the company. To transer the website code to the web server, FTP's or File Transfer Protocols are used.
