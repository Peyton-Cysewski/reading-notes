## Object Literals

Objects essentially group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of something that you might recognize in the real world. Variables inside of functions are called properties and functions are called methods. Similar to how these things can have names, inside of objects they are called keys and values, to make key-value pairs.

Objects are accessed using dot notation. First an object name is refernced, then its key is added with a dot in between them.

## Document Object Model /(DOM/)

The DOM is an API that models how html files are created and modified that also uses queries from CSS. It becomes a tree structure with each tag becoming an element node that houses its specific contect nodes and branches out its respective children element nodes below.

The general method of changing the DOM from JavaScript starts by selecting a node or set of nodes. Then you can work with the selected nodes and access further information or change the nodes. Nodes can also be added or removed. There is a lot of freedom. The list of specific commands is too large to list, but each action has a command that can be looked up.
