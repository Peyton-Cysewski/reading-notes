## Boxes

Boxes are the framework through which different elements of an html page are organized and therefore styled. Boxes have basic dimensions of height and width which can be changed with specific measurements or percentages of the screen size. These can be limited with min-width, max-width, min-height, and max-height.

Overflowing content can be told to be hidden or accessed with scroll.

The box model contains the base content, then there is a padding, a border, and padding. Borders can have width specifications and styles. They can be indivually changed or there are shorthand methods that can set simpler styles in a single line. Padding is usually used ot make the content of the element more readable. They margins that are outsid eof the border are collapsed when multiple elements are present, meaning that the larger margin is used and the smaller ones are simply disregarded.

Boxes can be centered by setting the left and right margins to auto to have them equally spaced.

Inline block, a setting of display, makes blocks act like inline elements. The display: none; feature makes an element not appear on the page at all. Using visibility: hidden; makes the element invisible, but it leaves a blank space.

Border images are what happens when an image is used around the sides. It can be stretched, repeated, or rounded.

Box shadows can be placed around the image, but there is also an inset option to have it displayed inside the image border.

Borders can be rounded using border-radius with the radii of each corner the same or specified. There is also a way to make elliptically rounded corners using extra argumetns to make the sides of the corner different lengths.
