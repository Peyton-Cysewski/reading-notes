Canvas is an API that allows its box attributes, heigth and width, to be changed using the DOM so that images can be drawn on it. Like its name suggests, it is a canvas. Rectangles can be drawn with strokeRect and all other shapes are drawn using paths that are in essence outlines for shapes. Different shapes can be rendered using strokeStyle. It allows possible looping iterations of shapes to be drawn on a canvas, each with differing qualities. Similar to shapes, text can be rendered and the styles of how it is displayed can be altered.
